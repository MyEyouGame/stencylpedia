## What is Pencyl?

Pencyl is Stencyl's built-in image editor. You can access it through Stencyl any time you need to edit an image on the fly. 

*(For example, when you're editing an actor animation frame, or a tileset frame, by pressing the Edit Image button in the lower right-hand corner)*

## Switching the Default Image Editor

Pencyl is the standard option for the image editor when you install Stencyl. You can change it to a different program (such as Photoshop), or change it back to Pencyl, by opening up the Preferences menu from the File dropdown menu.

By clicking on them, the Foreground and Background become black and white, respectively.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the program, you will see another vertical bar that lets you manipulate colors, gradients, and opacity. Each section on this bar has its own options for fine-tuning an image.</p>

## Supported Formats

When you're done, you can save your image in a variety of formats. Of these, we recommend sticking with PNG.

--- | --- | ---
**Native** | No | Saves under the extention .ie, which most, if not all, programs are unable to open. Don't use this one.
**JPEG** | Yes | Does not support transparency.
**GIF** | Yes | Allows transparency and is good with solid colored images
**PNG** | Yes | **The best for transparency and arguably the best format for sprite work.**

**BMP** | Yes | No transparency.
**PICT** | No | Does not open with Stencyl for Windows
**Targa** | No | Does not open in Stencyl.
**Sun Raster** | No | Does not open in Stencyl.
