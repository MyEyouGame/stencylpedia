## Why is reloading required?

Stencyl sometimes needs a little help knowing that something's changed if you keep multiple resources open at once.

When can this happen? For example, suppose that you've added a new Group and want to add an Actor Type to this new group. You'll notice that the Group doesn't show up in the dropdown.

Here are a few other cases where this can happen...

* Adding/Removing Controls
* Adding/Removing Groups
* Adding/Removing most kinds of Resources

Generally speaking, reload a document if in doubt.


## How to Reload

To reload a document, use the hotkey **Ctrl-R** (or **Command-R* on Mac). If prompted, click the button that says Reload Document.

Alternatively, you can do this from the menu via **File > Reload Document**.

 
## The Future

We understand that reloading is inconvenient. Down the road, we strive to eliminate the need to reload documents.
