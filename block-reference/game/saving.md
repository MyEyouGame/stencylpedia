## Actions

### <a name="save-game"></a> Save Game

![save-game-block](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/8%20-%20Game/1%20-%20Saving/save-game.png)

Tells the game to save. Saving will store the state of all game attributes into a file.

If the save operation succeeds, the embedded `save succeeded` block will return `true` and the enclosed blocks will run. If the save fails, the embedded `save succeeded` block will return `false`, and the enclosed blocks will still run.

```
saveGame("mySave", function(success:Bool):Void {
  [ACTIONS]
});
```

### <a name="load-game"></a> Load Game

![load-game-block](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/8%20-%20Game/1%20-%20Saving/load-game.png)

Tells the game to load. Loading will overwrite the values of all game attributes with those in the save file (if it exists).

If the load operation succeeds, the embedded `save succeeded` block will return `true` and the enclosed blocks will run. If the save fails, the embedded `save succeeded` block will return `false`, and the enclosed blocks will still run.

```
loadGame("mySave", function(success:Bool):Void {
  [ACTIONS]
});
```
